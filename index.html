        A Brief History of Ravenna Park
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        Just north of Seattle's University District neighborhood lies Ravenna Park, a
        lush, green space that has been home to hiking, biking, and picknicking for over 
        a century. While today anyone can enjoy the park and its amenities, it wasn't always open to
        the public. In fact, Ravenna Park has a rich history that dates back to the late 1880s, when 
        European settlers arrived in the area and began to develop the land. The land is not only
        historically significant, but also ecologically and culturally important to the indigenous
        peoples who initially called Ravenna Park home.
