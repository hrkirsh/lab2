        <!-- Section 1 content -->
        The area now known as Ravenna Park was initially purchased by William and Sarah Bell who were some of Seattle’s
        first pioneer settlers. The deep ravine that ran through the area made it unsuitable for logging, which was what most of the land
        was being purchased for at the time. The couple sold the land years 
        before Sarah’s death, and it was eventually purchased by George and Oltide Durffel in 1887. That same year, the land 
        was established as Ravenna Springs Park, referring to the natural springs which were believed to have medicinal qualities. 
        Just two years later, the park was sold to William and Louise Beck along with over 300 acres of the surrounding land. With 
        the vision of a prosperous town on their newly purchased land, the Becks built Seattle Female College, a post office, and a 
        grocery store.
