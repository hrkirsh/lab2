        While the natural beauty of Ravenna Park attracted 
        visitors and some homeowners, it was relatively far 
        from downtown. David Denny's Seattle Street Railway 
        was extended to the area in 1892, and named Ravenna Station 
        in 1895. While the Becks' idea for a town was abandoned 
        following the 1893 economic crash, they continued investing 
        in the park. The construction of trails attracted many more 
        visitors, and some considered the park one of Seattle's prime attractions.
