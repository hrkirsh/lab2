        The town of Ravenna was officially formed in 1906 just to be annexed a year later by the city of Seattle. 
That same year, the city followed Olmstedâ€™s 1903 plan to build scenic boulevards, leading to Ravenna Creek 
being diverted into a sewer. This dried up the natural stream and damaged the local ecosystem. In 1913, 
Roosevelt's tree was discovered to be missing. With help from University of Washington's Winkenwerder, 
it was discovered that destructive logging activities had been occurring in the park. While the city
promised not to cut down any more of the park's historic giant trees, they were all gone within years.
